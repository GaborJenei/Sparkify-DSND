# Sparkify-DSND

Sparkify is a (imaginary) popular music streaming service, similar to Spotify or Pandora.
Millions of users stream music every day using either the free tier with advertisements placed in-between songs or using the monthly subscription package with no advertisements.

Users can upgrade, downgrade or cancel anytime so it's crucial they like the service

Every interaction with the service (play a song, like, login, logout, upgrade, etc.) is recorded, hoping that this dataset will be able to help us to gain some insights.

The overall goal of this project is to try to identify users before they leave so they can be offered different incentives increasing the chance of not cancelling the service.
